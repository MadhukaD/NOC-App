# NOC App V2.0

This is the enhanced version of the existing NOC mobile application which use by Network Operation Center in Sri Lanka Telecom to manage their day-to-day network operations.

## Whats new in NOC App V2.0

- New and User-Friendly UIs.
- Gain quick insights through Google Maps without diving deep.
- Easy access to main operations with a single click.
- Added the features which were only accessible through web applications.

## Tool Stack

Figma tool was used to design the UIs and used Flutter to build the app for cross-platforms. To interact with the databases, I integrated the already implemented SOAP web services and Google Maps to interact with the location-based operations. Used SOAP UI sosftware to test the web services. Android Studio was used as the development platform.
