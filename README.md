## Tool Stack

The UIs were designed using the Figma tool, while the app was built for cross-platform compatibility using Flutter. To interact with the databases, I integrated the existing SOAP web services, and incorporated Google Maps for location-based operations. Testing of the web services was conducted using SOAP UI software. Android Studio served as the primary development platform.
